## Description
A Table::ColGroup::Col object represents a single `<COL>` instance for an HTML Table.

## Notes
In virtually every respect the Table::ColGroup::Col class is identical to
the Table::Row::Data class. The only differences are that a Table::ColGroup::Col
instance does not contain any content, nor does it include an end tag.
