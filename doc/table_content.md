## Description
A Table::Content is a wrapper for content used for Table::Row::Data and
Table::Row::Header objects.  Although it can be instantiated directly, in
practice it is autogenerated for you.

## Notes
Table::Content is a subclass of String and was mostly created in order
to support a DSL style syntax as well as physical tags.

## Synopsis
```ruby
content = Table::Content.new('my content') do
  bold        true
  italics     true
  underline   true
end
```
