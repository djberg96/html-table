## Description
A Table::ColGroup object represents a single `<COLGROUP></COLGROUP>`
instance for an HTML Table.

## Notes
In virtually every respect the Table::ColGroup class is identical to the
Table::Row class.  The only difference, beyond the begin and end tags, is
that a ColGroup may only contain instances of the Col class.
