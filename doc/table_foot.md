## Description
A Table::Foot object represents a single `<TFOOT></TFOOT>` instance for an HTML Table.

## Notes
In virtually every respect the Table::Foot class is identical to the
Table or Table::Row class. There is one significant difference. The
Table::Foot class is a singleton. There can be only one Table::Foot
instance per table.
