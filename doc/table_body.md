## Description
A Table::Body object represents a single `<TBODY></TBODY>` instance for an HTML Table.

## Notes
In virtually every respect the Table::Body class is identical to
the Table or Table::Row class. Unlike Table::Foot or Table::Head, there
can be more than one instance (i.e. it's not a singleton class).
    
A Table::Body contains Table::Row objects.
